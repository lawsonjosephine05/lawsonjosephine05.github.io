          Based on The KingKiller Chronicle (Fan Fiction)


She woke up with a start, sweating profusely. Another nightmare, the fifth this week. 'Why do I try to sleep at all?', she wondered. But there was something odd this time. A Flash of red. She shrugged. Got out of bed, looking around, trying to remember where she was. One would think, having led a nomadic life for 17 years, she would've gotten accustomed to this. A new room, everyday. She never could. Who was beside her this time? Another rich noble brat, in all probability. She looked around, the roses from last night. 'Ugh! Roses...'

The immense sadness flooded her. It came with every morning. Her mind was racing. Racing through all the sad memories she didn't even think she remembered. Trying to keep her from standing up. From moving on.

She didn't have the luxury of indulging it. Nor did her body grant her freedom from it. But with time, she had learnt to combat it with rationality. She stayed. Fortified herself. One after another she brought the fears under control by arguing the futility of the emotions they triggered. This was now routine. So routine, that it was practically a reflex. She had, a while ago, decided that it was impossible to escape. One could only hope to function and slowly distract one's mind.

The last thoughts in line were those of red. Kvothe's feelings towards her. Any bystander could see how Kvothe felt about her. But her pessimism wouldn't allow that. Oddly enough, she even preferred believing otherwise. Alar works in many ways, she thought.

She needed to believe that he didn't care. That way, he would never stop caring. For, were he to know what it was that plagued her mind....no, that didn't sound right. That would imply that she knew what it was. Wry laughter rang through her mind. Kvothe never demands the simpler of secrets, does he? She smiled quietly at this.

Got dressed and slipped out of the window. No note for the poor boy who lay asleep in the white sheets. Hell, someone needs to pay the bills, she thought. And yet he would come looking for her later. Despite her cruelty, Sovoy would come. For a moment, guilt struck a chord. Maybe it was time to stick around for someone. A millisecond later, she came to her senses, climbed down the rusted pipe and slipped into the crowded streets of Imre.

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
