<p align='justify'>

She sits down. Her cheeks flex into an automatic smile. Her spoon wades through the usual cafeteria-n mush. Her mind wanders. She feels a mild warmth, slowly creeping up the base of her neck and ears. A certain redness, dyeing her cheeks. The warmth grows into a heat. A cold flame envelops her brain. The left hemisphere is throbbing now. Her friend, from across the table was tapping out a tune with a fork. Her head, in turn, resonated faithfully.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
The din slowly dissolves into an unnatural silence. A silence filled with a high pitched white noise. The conversation slips away first. She can barely hear her own voice. Her eyes are losing focus. Time to head back.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
She's in her room. Seated still, seated straight. The silence is now filled with the sounds of her own heavy breathing. Her chest tightening, her thoughts racing. She can see the straight jacket materialize from thin air. She stares, helplessly. Tears running down her otherwise stolid face. As her eyes examine her body, her surrounding dissolves.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Her mother is across the street, conversing with dolls. A crowd, gathering around her. Pitiful stares take their stand. She begs her mother to understand, at least listen.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
'Mother, we need to leave.'
</p>
<p align='justify'>
'But, they're such wonderful people, dear,' her mother insists,'It's only polite.'
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Her mother turns to the Russian dolls,' Forgive her, she is usually very well mannered.'
</p>
<p align='justify'>
The girl croaks.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
'Just a little longer,' she tells herself. ' It'll pass, just hold out a little longer...'
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Sandman, do tell
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Is it dream that I see
</p>
<p align='justify'>
embellish the borders of reality
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Ladders of intricate lies
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Laden bright
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Far too clear,
</p>
<p align='justify'>
A memory of the night.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
As daughter cries,
</p>
<p align='justify'>
The mother speaks,
</p>
<p align='justify'>
To dolls of smiles complete.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Sandman,
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Grant thee my wish,
</p>
<p align='justify'>
So a dream,
</p>
<p align='justify'>
This may be.
