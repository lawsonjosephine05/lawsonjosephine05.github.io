She woke up with a start, sweating profusely. Another nightmare, the fifth this week. 

'Why do I try to sleep at all?', she wondered. 
But there was something odd this time. A Flash of red. She shrugged. She got out of bed trying to remember where she 
was. One would think that having led a nomadic life for 17 years, she would've gotten accustomed to waking up in a 
new room everyday but she never could. Who was beside her this time? Another rich noble brat, in all probability. 
She looked around, the roses from last night. 'Ugh! Roses...'

</p>
<p>
Immense sadness flooded her mind. It came with every morning. Her mind was racing. Racing through all the sad memories
she didn't even think she remembered. It tried relentlessly to keep her from standing up. From moving on. She didn't 
have the luxury of indulging it nor did her body grant her freedom from it. But with time, she had learnt to combat it
with rationality. She stayed. Fortified herself. One after another she brought the fears under control by arguing the 
futility of the emotions they triggered. This was now routine. So routine, that it was practically a reflex. 
She had, a while ago, decided that it was impossible to escape. One could only hope to function and slowly distract one's mind.

The last thoughts in line were those of red. Kvothe's feelings towards her. Any spectator could see how Kvothe felt 
about her. But her pessimism wouldn't allow that. Oddly enough, she even preferred believing otherwise. Alar works in 
many ways, she thought.

She needed to believe that he didn't care. That way, he would never stop caring. For, were he to know what it was that 
plagued her mind...No, that didn't sound right. That would imply that she knew what it was. Wry laughter rang through 
her mind. Kvothe never demands the simpler of secrets, does he? She smiled quietly at this. Got dressed and slipped out
of the window. No note for the poor boy who lay asleep in the white sheets. Hell, someone needs to pay the bills, 
she thought. And yet he would come looking for her later. Despite her cruelty, Sovoy would come. For a moment, 
guilt struck a chord. Maybe it was time to stick around for someone. A millisecond later, she came to her senses,
climbed down the rusted pipe and slipped into the crowded streets of Imre.
